# Possessed-Portrait
Spooky Portrait

I stumbled across https://www.hackster.io/dominick-marino/possessed-portrait-updated-32a7a6 as a project for Halloween. I quickly realised, that the initial solution is technically outdated and I had some strugles making it work.
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to make this work with Raspberry Pi 5 and at time of creation current versions of python, mpv player etc.

 1. Purchase the Media files at https://atmosfx.com/collections/halloween/products/unliving-portraits
 2. Get a Raspberry Pi 5 and a decent MicroSD card
 3. Install Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) using Raspberry Pi Imager (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
